Incident	Cause	Troubleshooting Steps	Solution
Allocation Failure (SkuNotAvailable)	Azure's host cluster in the selected region/zone lacks the physical capacity for the requested VM Size (SKU) at that moment.	1. Verify Region/Zone: Check the availability documentation for the SKU. 2. Check Logs: Review the deployment logs for the specific SkuNotAvailable code.	1. Try a Different SKU: Select a slightly smaller or larger VM size (e.g., D4s_v5 instead of D2s_v5). 2. Try a Different Region/Zone: Rerun the deployment in a nearby region that has capacity. 3. Wait and Retry: Capacity is dynamic; retry the deployment later.
Invalid Template/Config	Error in the ARM template, Terraform script, or CLI parameters (e.g., incorrect resource naming conventions, image ID is wrong, or missing required properties).	1. Check Validation Output: Azure deployment returns a detailed error pointing to the faulty line/parameter. 2. Review Naming Rules: Ensure resource names comply with Azure conventions (e.g., length, allowed characters).	1. Correct Template Syntax: Fix the identified error in the configuration file. 2. Use Test Deployments: For ARM, use the "What-If" feature (az deployment group what-if) before actual deployment.
Quota Exceeded	The subscription has reached its service limit for a specific resource, most commonly vCPU cores or the total number of Public IP addresses.	1. Check Quota Usage: Use the Azure portal or CLI to check current core usage against the subscription limit for the failing region.	1. Request a Quota Increase: Submit a support request to Azure to raise the vCPU or resource limit for the specific region. 2. Delete Unused Resources: Deallocate/delete unused VMs, Public IPs, or other resources contributing to the quota usage.
